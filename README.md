# Malware Detection and Prediction

This repository contains projects related to malware detection and prediction using machine learning techniques. The projects focus on both website malware detection and portable executable (PE) malware prediction.

## Website Malware Detection

### Problem Statement

With the growth of technology, the number of malware is also increasing day by day. Traditional signature-based malware detection methods are becoming ineffective against the vast variation of malware. This project aims to evaluate different classification models to predict malicious and benign websites based on application layer and network characteristics.

### Content

The project consists of evaluating different machine learning classifiers to predict malicious and benign websites using application layer and network characteristics. The dataset used for this project is obtained from various verified sources of malicious and benign URLs. The dataset includes information from sources such as machinelearning.inginf.units.it, malwaredomainlist.com, and zeuztacker.abuse.ch.

### Context

Malicious websites pose a significant security concern, and analyzing them one by one is challenging. This project aims to create a dataset with characteristics of both malicious and benign websites to aid in malware detection research.

### Dataset

The dataset for website malware detection is obtained from various sources, including machinelearning.inginf.units.it, malwaredomainlist.com, and zeuztacker.abuse.ch. The dataset contains approximately 185,181 URLs that are initially identified as potentially malicious.

## Portable Executable Malware Prediction

### Problem Statement

This project aims to predict portable executable (PE) malware using Neural Networks implemented with TensorFlow. The project utilizes a dataset containing raw PE files converted into image representations for machine learning analysis.

### Dataset

The dataset used for portable executable malware prediction is taken from Kaggle. It consists of raw PE files converted into image representations for machine learning analysis.

### Requirements

To run the portable executable malware prediction project, you need Python 3.x installed. The required Python packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using the following command:

For pip version 19.1 or above:

~~~bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
~~~

or

~~~bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
~~~

### Future Scopes
Build different Neural Network architectures involving Convolutions and Recurrent cells.
Use a different sampling method to overcome class imbalance.
