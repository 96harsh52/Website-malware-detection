Website malware detection
# Problem Statement
With the growth of technology, the number of malware are also increasing day by day.
Malware now are designed with mutation characteristic which causes an enormous
growth in number of the variation of malware (Ahmadi, M. et al., 2016). Not only that,
with the help of automated malware generated tools, novice malware author is now able
to easily generate a new variation of malware (Lanzi, A. et al., 2010). With these growths
in new malware, traditional signature based malware detection are proven to be
ineffective against the vast variation of malware (Feng, Z. et al., 2015). On the other
hand, machine learning methods for malware detection are proved effective against
new malwares. At the same time, machine learning methods for malware detection
have a high false positive rate for detecting malware (Feng, Z. et al., 2015).

# Content
The project consisted to evaluate different classification models to predict malicious and benign
websites, based on application layer and network characteristics. The data were obtained by using
different verified sources of benign and malicious URL's, in a low interactive client honeypot to
isolate network traffic. We used additional tools to get other information, such as, server country with Whois.
This is the first version and we have some initial results from applying machine learning classifiers in a bachelor thesis. Further details on the data process making and the data description can be found in the article below.

# Context
Malicious websites are of great concern due it is a problem to analyze one by one and to index each
URL in a black list. Unfortunately, there is a lack of datasets with malicious and benign web
characteristics. This dataset is a research production of my bachelor students whose aims to fill this gap.
This is our first dataset version got from our web security project, we are working to improve its
results.

# URL Dataset
This is an important topic and one of the most difficult thing to process, according to other articles and another open resource, we used three black list:
● machinelearning.inginf.units.it/data-andtools/hidden-fraudulent-urls-dataset
● malwaredomainlist.com
● zeuztacker.abuse.ch
From them we got around 185181 URLs, we supposed that they were malicious according to their
information, we recommend in a next research step to verity them though another security tool, such
as, VirusTotal.
